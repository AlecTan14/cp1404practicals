#1 What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?**
I've found that I work better when setting aside large chunks of code at a time rather than working in small updates, this helps me to work around my ADHD condition and still be productive.

#2 What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?**
Even though I work better in bigger chunks at a time, I still need to get enough done at the beginning so that I'm not left with a large chunk to finish at the end.

#3 What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?**
I take the skills learned in class and apply them to real world applications which interest me, this way I can practice the material taught in class while also tackling real world problems and projects which I'm passionate about.

#4 What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?**
I would need to delegate time in such a way that I am now in a constant state of having to "catch up"

#5 What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?**
I very much value group projects as they allow for individuals to share their different approaches with each other and I feel that it enhances the overall learning experience when collaboration is involved.
